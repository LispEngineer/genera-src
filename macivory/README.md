These are MacIvory III (or at least MacIvory) specific files
for Genera 8.3.

* `apple-keyboard-ii.lisp` - modifies the keyboard mapping
to be useful with the smaller Apple Keyboard II instead of the
default Apple Extended Keyboard II. See source for details on
its mapping. The new mapping is entirely usable on the AEKII
as well, however, since that has all AKII keys.
