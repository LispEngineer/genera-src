# GCZM - Genera CLIM Z-Machine

This is an "Infocom" Z-Machine Interpreter targeting Genera using
CLIM 2.0+ for the GUI. It is intended to play v3 Z-machine programs
only (for now).

# Main Loop

The initial plan is:

1. Start up CLIM application shell
2. Load initial (hard coded for now) Z-machine state from story file
3. Run Z-machine
4. At a READ z-machine opcode (z-code? z-instruction?) return control to CLIM
5. Accept a string or a clicked menu-bar command from CLIM
6. If a menu-bar command, do that (e.g., quit, load)
7. If a string, return control to z-machine with that input

# TODO

1. Accept "accelerator" keys for menu items, e.g., m-Q for quit
2. Implement z-machine minimally
3. Implement test scripts
